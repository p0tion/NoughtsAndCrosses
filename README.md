# NoughtsAndCrosses

Noughts and Crosses is a simple game played by two players. The first player after introducing himself to the system,
should choose, with whom he will play as a second player - with a human or machine. After that the first player may
choose a side: crosses (Xs), noughts (Os) or a random choice. The Noughts and Crosses board is a square grid
containing nine cells arranged in threes. During the game players should input coordinates of cells, where they want
to place their Xs or Os. From the second turn each player have a right to cancel previous circle of moves and return
to his previous turn by inputing 'R'. On each turn a player may exit the game by inputing "EXIT". First who gets a
line of three Os or three Xs in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row - is a winner.
Note: the game is best displayed in system console, not in a IDEs' console.
